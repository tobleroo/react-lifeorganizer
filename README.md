React todo app

this app will start with a simple todo page that i will then connect to a rest API using c# 
The idea is to later extend the website with more features such as journals and auto-generating tasks, etc.

# Features

- save tasks to the database , so that they can be assigned later on to whichever date.
- selected each day from the calendar from the right, and then add or remove tasks from that specific day
